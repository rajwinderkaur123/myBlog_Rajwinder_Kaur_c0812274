         "If I talk about my school life, I was a bright student.I always got good position in class. Apart from study, I loved to participate 
          in other school activities like games, quiz competitions and camps. Because I thought that for overall development we should not only focus on study
          but also have interest in extra curriculum. I really enjoyed my whole school life. "
